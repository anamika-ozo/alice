# server directory

### intended purpose

the intended purpose behind this directory is for the compiler to send & receive code for the compiler to process

yes, the issue behind this is that hard-coding in a server to work on something like Netlify _will_ cause issues & that's something I'm intending to fix with an option to disable the compiler option altogether - having the end user either fill in their own domain for the compiler to work, throw an error if they enabled it & tried making it run on localhost, etc etc

### will i ever get this done

well uhm.. we'll see.
