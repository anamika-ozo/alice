# discord-bot

I restarted this project for fun, and this time it's much better in comparison to my old code which you can see here;
https://github.com/Mioroxi/discord-bot

### Features

- Has a bit of a personality, and will post an image in accordance with a keyword; i.e. typing 'l-lewd' will make her moan.
- Good for shutting people up with the mute function
- Kick/ban members (works for admins/mods only)
- She'll try to bump your server..
- If you bully her she'll cry, and at worst she'll turn sentient and start muting users and crying. Yea, she cries a lot...
- She can fetch images from danbooru pretty well, that works on a cooldown.
- She can talk with some users in a very basic manner, but ultimately fails at conversation, much like her creator.

### Usage

Clone this repository and run `node .` in the working directory.

## "Why would I use this?"
For your own sanity, please don't. Or do if you want a good laugh and a fried brain.
