# bedo bot :D

(name is a WIP as well as the rest of this crap)

I restarted this project for fun, and this time it's much better in comparison to my old code which you can see on the testing branch (lol!)

### Features

- Has a bit of a personality, and will post an image in accordance with a keyword; i.e. typing 'l-lewd' will make her moan.

- Good for shutting people up with the mute function

- Kick/ban members (works for admins/mods only)

- She'll try to bump your server..

- If you bully her she'll cry

  ##### WIP

- She can fetch images from danbooru 

- She can talk with some users in a very basic manner, but ultimately fails at conversation, much like her creator.

- You can send her C, Elixir/Erlang & Scala code and she'll compile it & return the output & the compiled file (i.e. elixir will print .exs files, C will give you an a.out, and Scala will return a .class file)

- She can send you copypastas fetched from the internet as well as random stuff from open APIs around the web (not sure if thats totally legal but, i dont care)

### Usage

Clone this repository, add your discord token in the env.ex file and run `node .` in the working directory.
Alternatively, you can create your own config.json file, input whatever you want & host it on gitlab too

## "Why would I use this?"
For your own sanity, please don't. Or do if you want a good laugh and a fried brain.
